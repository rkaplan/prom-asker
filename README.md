<h2>prom-asker</h2>
A program to ask my girlfriend to prom. 

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download and install [SleepWatcher](http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/) on your girlfriend or boyfriend's machine. Then add .wakeup and .prom/ from this repository to their home directory. Edit the file path in .prom/changeDesktop.txt to reflect the correct path to the user's home directory. Finally, be sure to make .wakeup and .prom/callAppscript.sh executable (chmod +x).

<h2>Usage</h2>
After installation, the desktop background will change to the next letter in the sequence "PROM?" each time the computer is woken from sleep. Good luck!
